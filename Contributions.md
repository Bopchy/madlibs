## Github Workflow

#### Branches 
There's 2 main branches:
    - **master**
    - **development**
Only repo owner can merge to master. Merging to development requires an accepted code owner review.

#### How to contribute
To contribute:
    - make a feature branch off development
    - once done, make a PR asking to merge you feature branch into development
    - PR will then be merged after code owner review approval.
